<h1>Portable Audio SUCKS ðŸŽ§</h1>
</header>
<div class=content__body>
<p>One thing Iâ€™ve been thinking about is how much modern portable music listening <em><strong>SUCKS</strong></em>. In 2022 you have two options basically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using your phone with wireless headphones or some stupid dongle <br>
<em>or</em></li>
<li>A poorly designed DAP</li>
</ul>
<p>Neither are very good in my opinion and I think itâ€™s stupid how much weâ€™ve gone backwards in the way we listen to music on the go.</p>
<p>Using your phone to listen to music is no fun. Itâ€™s constantly buzzing in your pocket from the rush of push notifications whether you want them or not. Streaming is pretty convenient until you find out one of your favorite artists or albums isnâ€™t available in your region, or isn&rsquo;t on the service you pay for so you have to improvise or just live without it.</p>
<p>So just download all your music right? Well not quite. Most phones have non removable storage these days and let&rsquo;s not mention the fact that lazy developers now allow their apps to eat up gigabytes of data just for messaging apps.</p>
<p>The removal of headphone jacks on most phones pushed for sales of bluetooth headphones but not a lot of them are very good. Airpods are actually very practical but you find them very useful unless you&rsquo;re in the Apple ecosystem. Most other &ldquo;true wireless earbuds&rdquo; and headphones have poor controls meaning youâ€™ll often be sliding your phone in and out of your pocket just to change the track <del>unless you want to look like a dork swiping around your ears</del></p>
<p>On the audiophile side you have DAPs. The horrible frankenstein child of MP3 players and smartphones. This monstrosity of a category has possibly the worst of both worlds.</p>
<p>Theyâ€™re often bulky, because they have high spec internals to appeal to the hardcore audiophile with golden ears. They have extremely ugly styling usually either looking like a generic Android phone with a few extra inches of girth or some utilitarian monster with clunky and confusing non musical controls.</p>
<p><img src=/images/A_norma_SR15_04_2048x2048_620b337b-3885-4f81-be86-505e80b504d6_1600x.jpeg alt></p>
<p><em>Who does this appeal to? It looks hideous!</em></p>
<p>Why does it need a touch screen? Who came up with this idea? Why does my device built <em><strong>specifically</strong></em> for music listening need such a big ass screen? To watch TV on it? All it does is drain the battery.</p>
<p><img src=/images/m3k-hifi-metal-shell-music-player-with-16gb-memory-card-and-original-imafxndbgzva9fgn.jpeg alt></p>
<p><em>This isn&rsquo;t much better to be honest. Why does it have capacitive controls? To look like a fucking microwave control panel? You won&rsquo;t be able to feel the buttons in your pocket.</em></p>
<p><img src=/images/2022-01-2201.31.30.jpg alt></p>
<p><em>I love this one. It almost makes sense. But it&rsquo;s so ugly. And what are the controls even? Why do you need a Function key? What is the point of the Setup key being there either?</em></p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re not pocket friendly at all. They&rsquo;re also not sanity friendly either. DAPs will use whatever Chinese developed OS they can source or run some outdated version of Android.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hilarious seeing some of these insanely high end devices barely struggle with basic inertia scrolling. Let&rsquo;s not mention the plethora of glitches you&rsquo;ll encounter just trying to listen to some tunes. And all of the software updates because of course they canâ€™t just release a complete product that works out of the box.</p>
<p>Now sure, using good IEMs and whatever coupled with high res lossless streaming or local files will get you some great sound. But you wonâ€™t get great battery life. A decent battery life for a DAP is ~13 hours. Thatâ€™s pretty terrible for something that just plays music.</p>
<p>Now of course no one listens to 13 hours continuously on the go but itâ€™s still annoying that this thing has to charge almost as often as your phone. Itâ€™s 2022 and your outlets are probably already cluttered by a million other devices and gadgets. Adding a DAP to that mess is just uggghhh.</p>
<p>2022 . 20 years ago, in 2002, the world of portable audio was very different. CD Walkmans were on the way out, the Minidisc portables were hitting their peak with Sharp&rsquo;s Auvi players and Sony&rsquo;s impossibly small MZ-E10 and the iPod was just taking off with it&rsquo;s second model <em>(still Mac only at the time)</em>.</p>
<p><strong>This was the peak of portable music.</strong></p>
<p>It might sound like a stretch but taking a deeper look you see that we really had it good. To simplify things I am just gonna be looking at MD today <del>(sorry iPod)</del>.</p>
<p>ðŸ’½</p>
<p>The thing about Minidisc players is that they were sensibly designed. Because it only needed to play music, it was specifically designed and optimized for music.</p>
<p>An average run time for a Minidisc player at the time was 40-50 hours on a (replacable) rechargeable battery and even reaching 100+ on a single AA once you mounted the sidecar adapter. These things didnâ€™t have giant backlit screens and Wi-Fi draining your battery.</p>

<em>The Sony MZ-E10</em></p>
<p>You didnâ€™t need to lug around a power bank in case your phone or headphones die (I wish powerbanks didn&rsquo;t suck). If your Minidisc player somehow died, hopefully you have your sidecar adapter with you so you can attach a AA battery and youâ€™re good to go.</p>
<p>The devices were easily pocketable and the media was a good size. Small enough to even carry in your wallet, you could fit plenty of discs in a jacket pocket. But not ridicilously small enough to easily lose like a microSD card.</p>
<p><img src=/images/panasonic_sjmj17_lineup.jpeg alt></p>
<p>They were sleek and stylish and had more personality than a brick with weird geometric sharp angles and a glass screen (maybe a couple of buttons if you are lucky). But unlike the DAPs of today you didnâ€™t actually have to take it out of your pocket to do anything. <em>And no I&rsquo;m not talking about homoerotic gesture controls!</em></p>
<p><img src=/images/63050105image27.jpeg alt></p>
<p><em>The Sony RM-MC11EL</em></p>
<p>Most MD players didn&rsquo;t even feature a screen on the unit. Everything was accessible via the backlit remote where your headphones plugged in. You could check the track info, skip tracks by using the knob on the side or pull it out and adjust volume (kinda like setting the time on a wristwatch). Units even featured EQ, speed of playback, bookmarking your favorite tracks, etc. <strong>And it still looks damn cool.</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately not everyone is a contrarian like I am. People donâ€™t care enough. Sure they will complain about the inconveniences but the fact is that most people will put up with it because their phone is a window which they live through.</p>
<p>Spotify will serve them daily mixes of music chosen by an algorithm based on the music they listen to. Then they show you how much they track you at the end of the year and people eat it up. But it&rsquo;s caused this effect where people have thousands of songs in a playlist and people don&rsquo;t really care much about the music they listen to. It&rsquo;s no longer fun. It&rsquo;s just disposable like everything else today.</p>
<p>I like to have fun though. I like that you can just have these neat little discs with a couple of CDs worth of songs on each, and carry them around knowing youâ€™re always in control of when, where and how you listen to it. Itâ€™s just fun to use.</p>

<p><em>TDK Bit Club blank recordable discs</em></p>
<p>I may have a very old fashioned way of thinking but I like that I can play music on this thing and just forget about it. I donâ€™t worry that the music I want to listen to isnâ€™t available on this or that streaming platform. I donâ€™t worry that the music Iâ€™m listening to right now might get pulled next week due to licence expiration or something. I donâ€™t worry about my Airpods running out of juice and having to wait for them to recharge in the case. I don&rsquo;t worry about Spotify randomly switching me from playing an album on repeat to playing some random selection from their algorithm</p>
<p>I just plug my earbuds in, press play and listen to the music.</p>
<p><strong>2002 really had it figured out.</strong></p>
