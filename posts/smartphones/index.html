<h1>Smartphones are breeding a generation of computer illiterate kids</h1>
</header>
<div class=content__body>
<p>Before I start talking smack, let me give a little background. I&rsquo;m almost 19. I&rsquo;ve been using computers probably since I was like 2 or 3 years old. Having a father who worked with tech and stuff naturally led me to use computers more than most kids back then. I got a pretty big head start.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m also still a kid in the eyes of many.</p>
<p>However I feel like not many kids today have the same opportunity I did. There&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s been lost in the last decade with the rise of smartphones. Recently I was asked by my barber to help his son get his laptop up and running and install whatever programs he needed and I agreed.</p>
<p>His son is 10 and owns both a laptop and a smartphone. But he rarely uses his laptop. His dad tries hard to push him to be on the phone less and more on the computer. He&rsquo;s a pretty smart kid but he just doesn&rsquo;t know much about computers. He doesn&rsquo;t need to though because his phone serves him simplified versions of all the programs you&rsquo;d find on the desktop.</p>
<p>I had to explain to this kid that on a desktop computer you can&rsquo;t download apps from Google Play but rather you need to actually find websites hosting the program you want. He seems to think that it&rsquo;s stupid that you have to go to a browser and type in youtube.com to watch YouTube.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Do I have to use a browser, why isn&rsquo;t there an app?"</em></p>
<p>Kids are so used to apps that they rarely think about the web equivalents. A lot of kids don&rsquo;t even know what a browser is and refer to the browser as Google. And the apps they use are simplified versions of programs you&rsquo;d see on a normal desktop. Instead of Photoshop you have apps like FaceTune or Photoshop Express or whatever which instead of having general purpose image manipulation tools have dumbed down situation specific functions (i.e. instead of a clone stamp brush, the app sports a Remove Blemishes button).</p>
<p>This applies to all kinds of apps. There exist apps for editing videos on a phone but instead of having a complicated multi track timeline, they opt to have just one. This makes the app easier to use but also severely limits creativity. I could go on and on about these apps but the point is these dumbed down apps make kids complacent and not willing to explore all of the possibilities because they&rsquo;re fenced in by shitty neutered apps.</p>
<p>Now people have done amazing things with limited tools and resources but there&rsquo;s something different about apps. Apps don&rsquo;t inspire creativity because they skip the whole you doing things process. Instead the phone does it&rsquo;s thing and you get to pick from a few end results. You didn&rsquo;t edit that picture, your phone did and you just picked from a few preset actions the app has and adjusted a few sliders.</p>
<p>Another result of this is that some things that are incredibly simple on desktop varients of these programs are basically impossible on their mobile counterparts. Because you are in control of the tools on desktop, you can choose what they do. You can&rsquo;t do that with most mobile apps. A desktop app is a tool but a phone app is more like having another person doing it for you and then you have to approve it or make changes. You won&rsquo;t ever be satisfied with it cause it doesn&rsquo;t feel like you made it.</p>
<p>The phone is like your butler. It spoils you. You never find anything on it yourself. It always feeds you content on it&rsquo;s own. It predicts what you were trying to type. It makes you playlists to listen to. It shows you what your friends are doing so you never have to ask.</p>
<p>A computer is a tool. Smartphones used to be.</p>
<p>So what does this mean for future generations? Well they&rsquo;re going to be the less and less computer literate. Why do you need to know how a computer works when it does things on it&rsquo;s own and only asks you for input when it needs to? You don&rsquo;t! Just sit there with your phone and consume content all day.</p>
